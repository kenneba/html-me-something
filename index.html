        <p><strong>A Town, Atlanta, The A;</strong> whatever you call it, I love it. Atlanta is one of my favirite cities on the East Coast. At one point in my life I planned to move to one of the suburbs but life happensa and I wasn't able to make the move. From June 19th to June 23rd, 2017, I took a trip to Atlanta, GA. I have been quite a few times growning up as I have relatives in the area. But this trip was by far my favorite. I took the trip as a celebration of my 30th birthday. And while many people prefer to take group trips, I made this trip alone.</p>
